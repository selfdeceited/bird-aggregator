# bird-aggregator
Website that uses Flickr API to aggregate bird shot stats.

## Purpose
I use Flickr as a place to store photos I'm doing, and lately I'm enjoying to ~shoot~ take photos of birds in their natural habitat.
After first hundred of photos, I became wondering of how I can track type visit by date and time, show birds found in some location or simply store a life-list.
Also since I'm lazy, I would like to create an albums of bird photos, aggregated by type, specific trip or whatever comes in handy.

So I decided to get shots by Flickr API and expose some website to get info regarding what you want so that you would only need to set your name and flickrId and this gallery would work for you.
In order to make it work, your image captions should reflect this sort of format:

B: {bird-name-in-English, UpperCamelCased with spaces} ({Latin name})
### example:
_B: Great Tit (Parus major)_
_B: Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula)_

Stay tuned for updates!
