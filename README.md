# bird-aggregator
Use Flickr API to aggregate bird shots stats.

## Purpose
I use Flickr as a place to store photos I'm doing, and lately I'm enjoying to ~shoot~ take photos of birds in their natural habitat.
After first hundred of photos, I became wondering of how I can track type visit by date and time, show birds find in some location or simply store a life-list.
Also since I'm lazy, I would like to create an albums of bird photos, aggregated by type, specific trip or whatever comes in handy.

So I decided to get them by Flickr API and expose some API to get info you want.
In order to do it, you need to have a Flickr UserID and your image captions should reflect this soft of format:

*B: *{bird-name-in-English, UpperCamelCased with spaces} ({Latin name})
### example:
_B: Great Tit (Parus major)_
_B: Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula)_

Stay tuned for updates!
